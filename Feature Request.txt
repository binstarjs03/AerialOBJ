[] Draw overlay of alternating line, checkerboard pattern or whatever for chunk that is not yet generated. The overlay may be toggable
[] More chunk shaders or implement post-processing:
	- fancy chunk shader like minutor chunk renderer
	- lighting post-processing like minutor "View Lighting" mode
	- Minutor depth shading
	- Minutor biome-match terrain color
[] Multi-layer rendering (yes, put region image on top of each other), combine with chunk shaders for crazy cool rendering
