                            Chunk will be deallocated when they are no longer on 
                            visible area of the screen. 
                            This will save RAM usage but chunks will need reallocated back
                            when they are visible again which takes some time.

                            visible area of the screen. 
                            This will increase RAM usage the more chunks are visible
                            but improve user experience as chunks are persisted.

                            This setting makes AerialOBJ operate on minimum RAM usage amount
                            however when trying to change height limit, all chunks will need to
                            be re-rendered again in order to display the new height limit.
                        </RadioButton.ToolTip>

                    <RadioButton Content="Prefer Maximum Performance">
                        <RadioButton.ToolTip>
                            This setting makes AerialOBJ operate as fast as possible
                            at cost more RAM usage, however when trying to change height limit, 
                            all chunks will render the new height limit instantly.
                        </RadioButton.ToolTip>

                    <!--RadioButton Content="Prefer Maximum Responsiveness">
                        <RadioButton.ToolTip>
                            This setting is the slowest setting as AerialOBJ will operate
                            on single thread mode (for the viewport) and it uses Minimal RAM usage,
                            however AerialOBJ will be very resposive as it doesn't need to communicate
                            with other thread.
