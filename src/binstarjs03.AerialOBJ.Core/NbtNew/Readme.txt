This library is basically the rewritten version of the nbt library. 

I know it's silly why i do that, well its because the old nbt library is 
quite messy, especially the NbtIO of the old library, beside the old library 
is not so easy to maintain if i want to extend/modify that, so instead 
i rewrite the whole thing but this time, only write what is actually neccessary.

Also, the lines of source code in old nbt library is alot while in the new one,
its a fraction of it so yeah, maintaining it will be easy and i expect the old
library will become obsolette anytime soon. 

If you worry the old library will be deleted, we can always get it back 
from git commits and do detach checkout of which commit has the old library.
