# AerialOBJ - Minecraft World to 3D model and PNG mapper
![ezgif-1-1473f38051](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93080026/212500733-6cad8b8e-cb8a-4d74-9b22-282fb3fad37d.gif)

This is my personal experimental project on converting Minecraft worlds 
into 3D model or PNG map of the world, written in .NET C#.

The name AerialOBJ was chosen because this program is obviously
drawing Minecraft world in aerial view and it can convert to 3D model
in OBJ format.

Currently this repository is still work in progress.

## Compatibility
Currently AerialOBJ is using WPF technology and it support Windows only.
Compatibility with Mac and Linux is planned to be implemented.
