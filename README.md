# MineSharpOBJ

This is my personal experimental project on converting Minecraft worlds 
into 3D model, written in .NET C#.

The name MineSharpOBJ is derived from Minecraft itself and the C# 
(pronounced as "see sharp") language, so i combine both and name it 
as MineSharpOBJ. 

Note: during the time of this writing, the name "MineSharp" exist
as Minecraft Server hosting if i'm not mistaken. 
This is purely coincidence as i didn't know MineSharp was exist when 
i named this project as MineSharpOBJ.

Currently this repository is still work in progress (even it can't export 
to 3D model).
